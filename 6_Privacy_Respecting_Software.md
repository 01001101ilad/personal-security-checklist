# Privacy & Securty-Focused Software and Services
> A curated list of privacy-respecting apps, software and providers üîê

## Intro

You can greatly increase your digital security, by switching to privacy-respecting software. 
Using open-source applications with a strong emphasis on security, will help stop
large corporations profiting from your data, through logging, storing and selling your personal details.

## Password Managers

| Provider |Description |
| --- | --- |
**[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com)**  | Free and open source, cross-platform password manager with sync
**[1Password](https://1password.com)** | Open source, fully-featured cross-platform password manager with sync. Free for self-hosted (or $3/ month hosted)
**[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)** | Open source, secure password manager, but without cloud-sync capabilities. KeePassXC is a community fork of [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
**[LessPass](https://lesspass.com)** | LessPass is a little different, since it generates your passwords using a hash of the website name, your username and a single master-passphrase that you reuse. It ommits the need for you to ever need to store or sync your passwords. They have apps for all the common platforms and a CLI, but you can also self-host it.


## 2-Factor Authentication Apps

| Provider |Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Aegis](https://getaegis.app)**  | Free, secure and open source app for manageing 2-step verification tokens, on Android
**[AndOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP)** | Another open source, secure authanticator app. AndOTP is well established with a strong large user base

**Note:** Don't use your password manager to also store your 2-FA tokens- use a separate application.


## File Encryption

| Provider |Description |
| --- | --- |
**[VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)** | VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehnsive encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable eddition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now depricated) TrueCrypt.
**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** | Open source client-side encryption for cloud files- Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac- but also has excellant mobile apps.

If you need to create a compressed archive, prior to encrypting your files, then [PeaZip](https://www.peazip.org/) is a great little cross-platform open source file archiver utility. It allows you to create, open, and extract RAR TAR ZIP archives.

**Note**: In order to stay protected, it is important to also: Use strong and unique passwords, 2-factor authentication,
adopt good networking practices and be mindful of data that is collected when browsing the web. See the full
