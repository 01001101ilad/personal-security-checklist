# Privacy & Securty-Focused Software and Services
> A curated list of privacy-respecting apps, software and providers üîê

## Intro

If you want greatly increase your digital security, and protect your personal information, then
start migrating to encrypted, privacy-respecting open source software and services.
Using open-source applications with a strong emphasis on security, will help stop
large corporations, governments and hackers from logging, storing or selling your personal details.


## Password Managers

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com)**  | Free and open source, cross-platform password manager with sync
**[1Password](https://1password.com)** | Open source, fully-featured cross-platform password manager with sync. Free for self-hosted (or $3/ month hosted)
**[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)** | Open source, secure password manager, but without cloud-sync capabilities. KeePassXC is a community fork of [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
**[LessPass](https://lesspass.com)** | LessPass is a little different, since it generates your passwords using a hash of the website name, your username and a single master-passphrase that you reuse. It ommits the need for you to ever need to store or sync your passwords. They have apps for all the common platforms and a CLI, but you can also self-host it.


## 2-Factor Authentication

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Aegis](https://getaegis.app)**  | Free, secure and open source app for manageing 2-step verification tokens, on Android
**[AndOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP)** | Another open source, secure authanticator app. AndOTP is well established with a strong large user base

**Note:** Don't use your password manager to also store your 2-FA tokens- use a separate application.


## File Encryption

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr)** | VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehnsive encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable eddition. VeraCrypt is the successor of (the now depricated) TrueCrypt.
**[Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org)** | Open source client-side encryption for cloud files- Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use, but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works on Windows, Linux and Mac- but also has excellant mobile apps.

If you need to create a compressed archive, prior to encrypting your files, then [PeaZip](https://www.peazip.org/) is a great little cross-platform open source file archiver utility. It allows you to create, open, and extract RAR TAR ZIP archives.


## Encrypted Messaging

Without using a secure app for instant messaging, all your conversations, meta data and more is unprotected. Signal one of the best options- it's easy, yet also highly secure and privacy-centric.

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Signal](https://signal.org/)** | Probably one of the most popular, secure private messaging apps that combines strong encryption (see [Signal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)) with a simple UI and plenty of features. It's widely used across the world, and easy-to-use, functioning similar to WhatsApp - with instant messaging, read-receipts, support for media attachments and allows for high-quality voice and video calls. It's cross-platform, open-source and totally free. Signal is [recommended](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152) by Edward Snowden, and is a perfect solution for most users
**[KeyBase](https://keybase.io/)** | KeyBase allows encrypted real-time chat, group chats, and public and private file sharing. It also lets you cryptographically sign messages, and prove your ownership to other social identities (Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, etc), and send or receive Stella or BitCoin to other users. It's slightly more complex to use than Signal, but has some great cryptography features, and is good for group chats
**[Silence](https://silence.im/)** | If you're restricted to only sending SMS/MMS, then Silence makes it easy to encrypt messages between 2 devices. This is important since traditional text messaging is inherently insecure. It's easy-to-use, reliable and secure- but has fallen in popularity, now that internet-based messaging is often faster and more flexible
**[Matrix](https://matrix.org/)** | Matrix is a little different since it is a [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)) messaging service, hence provides an open network for secure, decentralized, real-time communication. [Riot](https://riot.im/) is a popular cross-platform, feature-full open source Matrix client. You can host your Matrix own server, or use existing ones- it functions in a similar way to Slack, so is good for groups, projects, and organizations
**[Jami](https://jami.net/)** | Jami is a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) service, meaning it connects message recipients to each other directly. P2P services don't require a third-party server, expose minimal data to third parties, and usually E2E encrypted by default. Other P2P alternatives include [Briar](https://briarproject.org/), [Bit Message](https://bitmessage.org/), and [Tox](https://tox.chat/) (beta)
**[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)** | Slightly harder to use, slower, but still widley used. Note that there are known issues in the PGP standard, but still considered secure for general purpose use. Using [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html), you can encrypt messages following the OpenPGP standard. OpenPGP was defined by the IETF, proposed in [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) and derived from the PGP software, (created by Phil Zimmermann, now owned by [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/products/encryption)). There have been vulnrabilities found in the OpenPGP and S/MIME, defined in [EFAIL](https://efail.de/), so it is often better to use an encrypted messaging or email app instead.

#### Other Notable Mentions
[Chat Secure](https://chatsecure.org/) and [Status](https://status.im/), are private, encrypted, open source messenger apps. They are both still in early stages, so were'nt included in the main list

#### Word of Warning: Closed Source Messaging 
Many messaging apps claim to be secure, but if they are not open source, then this cannot be verified- and they **should not be trusted**. This applies to [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [Threema](https://threema.ch), [Cypher](https://www.goldenfrog.com/cyphr), [Wickr](https://wickr.com/), [Silent Phone](https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/silent-phone/) and [Viber](https://www.viber.com/), to name a few- these apps should not be used to communicate any sensitive data.

## Virtual Private Networks

VPNs are good for getting round censorship, increasing protection on public WiFi, obscuring your IP address, and reducing what data your ISP can log. But for the most anonymity, you should use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

Before jumping in and signing up for a VPN, there's a couple of things to note:
- A VPN does not make you anonymous- it merely chnages your IP accress to that of your VPN provider, instead of ISP. Your browsing session can still be linked back to your real identity either through your system details (such as user agent, screen resolution even typing patterns), cookies/ session storage, or by the identifiable data that you enter. [Read more about fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/).
- VPNs and logging- If you choose to use a VPN because you do not agree with your ISP logging your full browsing history, then it is important to keep in mind that your VPN provider will have access to these logs. Many VPNs claim not to keep logs, but you cannot be certain of this. See [this article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) for more

You could host your own VPN, which would allow you to have full visibility and control over logs. See [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand)

| Provider |Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Mullvad](http://mullvad.net/en/)** | Mullvad is one of the best for privacy, they own all their own servers and have a totally anonymous sign up process, you don't need to provide any details at all, you can choose to pay annonymously too (with Monero, BTC or cash)
**[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)** | From the creators of ProtonMail, ProtonVPN has a solid reputation. They have a full suit of user-friendly native mobile and desktop apps. ProtonVPN is one of the few "trustworthy" providers that also offer a free plan

For a full-comparison, see: [thatoneprivacysite.net](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/).


## Browser Extensions

The following browser add-ons give you better controll over what content is able to be loaded and executed while your browsing.

| Provider | Description |

For Firefox users, you can do this through [browser settings](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#webrtc). Test for WebRTC leaks, with [browserleaks.com/webrtc](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc)
**[Vanilla Cookie Manager](https://github.com/laktak/vanilla-chrome)** | A Whitelist Manager that helps protect your privacy, through automatically removing unwanted cookies. **Download**: [Chrome][vanilla-cookie-chrome]
**[Privacy Essentials](https://duckduckgo.com/app)** | Simple extension by DuckDuckGo, which grades the security of each site. **Download**: [Chrome][privacy-essentials-chrome] \ [Firefox][privacy-essentials-firefox]

*Note: Be careful when installing unfamiliar browser add-ons, since some can compromise your security and privacy. The above list however are all open source, verified and safe extensions*


## Mobile Apps
| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
**[Orbot]** | System-wide Tor proxy, which encrypts your connection through multiple nodes. You can also use it alongside [Tor Browser] to access .onion sites
**[NetGaurd]** | A firewall app for Android, which does not require root. NetGuard provides simple and advanced ways to block access to the internet, where applications and addresses can individually be allowed or denied access to your Wi-Fi and/or mobile connection
**[Island]** | A sandbox environment, allowing you to clone selected apps and run them in an isolated box, preventing it from accessing your personal data, or devicce information
**[Exodus]** | Shows which trackers, each of your installed apps is using, so that you can better understand how your data is being collected. Uses data from the  Exodus database of scanned APKs.
**[Bouncer]** | Gives you the ability to grant permissions temporarily, so that you could for example use the camera to take a profile picture, but when you close the given app, those permissions will be revoked
**[Haven]** | Allows you to protect yourself, your personal space and your posessions- without compromising on security. Leveraging device sensors to monitor nearby space, Haven was developed by [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/), in partnership with [Edward Snowden](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/24/edward-snowden-haven-app/)
**[XUMI Security]** |  Checks for, and resolves known security vulnerabilities. Useful to ensure that certain apps, or device settings are not putting your security or privacy at risk
**[Daedalus]** | No root required Android DNS modifier and hosts/DNSMasq resolver, works by creating a VPN tunnel to modify the DNS settings. Useful if you want to change your resolver to a more secure/ private provider, or use DNS over HTTPS
